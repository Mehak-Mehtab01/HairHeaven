                <h2>CAUSES</h2>
                <p>1)Stress: Stress aggravates Pitta dosha and the production of melanocytes. <br>

                    2) Genetics: It's very common that if your parents or grandparents had grey hair at an early age, you would also develop it because of your genes. <br>
                    
                    3) Smoking: Cigarettes contain toxins that affect hair follicles and cause grey hair. Smoking also affects the blood supply to the hair follicles by shrinking the blood vessels <br>
                    
                   4) Decrease In Melanin Production: Melanin is a pigment that determines your hair's natural color [. Due to aging and hormonal imbalance, melanin production decreases in the hair follicles, causing grey hair</p>
                 <h2>TREATMENT OPTIONS</h2>

                 <P>A. Consume Vitamin B-12: Vitamin B-12 helps balance the production of melanin in the hair follicles. <br>

                    B. Yoga and Exercise: They help reduce stress and balance dosha levels. <br>
                    
                    C. Ayurvedic Herbs: Bhringraj, Triphala, Vibhitaka, Henna, and Hibiscus are some herbs that help cure premature greying. <br>
                    
                    D. Change Your Diet: Add iron, copper, and catalase rich food to your diet by consuming nuts and green leafy vegetables.</P>

                <h2>CAUSES</h2>
                <p>1) Stress: Stress is one of the primary reasons for the degradation of hair health. <br>

                    2) Dosha Imbalance: Imbalance in the three doshas can lead to hair damage. <br>
                    
                    3) Improper Diet: A diet that lacks essential nutrients, vitamins, proteins, and minerals can damage healthy hair and hinder your body's ability to build new hair follicles. <br>
                    
                    4) Excess Use Of Chemicals: Chemicals present in hair care products can damage the hair by making it dry and dull.</p>
                    <h2>TREATMENT OPTIONS</h2>
                    <P>A. Ayurvedic Therapies: Balance your dosha levels by following Ayurvedic Therapies that include Shirolipa (hair masks), Murdhani Taila (oiling), Snana (hair Wash), Dhumapana (medicated smoke) and Shiro Abhyanga (head Massage). <br>

                        B. Yoga and Pranayama: They help flush out toxins from your body and reduce stress levels. Also, yoga stimulates blood supply in the scalp that makes hair stronger and shinier. <br>
                        
                        C. Follow A Healthy Diet: It is necessary to provide nutrients to your hair by including vitamins like A, B, C, K, D, and minerals like zinc.</P>

                <h2>CAUSES</h2>
                <p>1) Dry Hair: Split ends happen when the ends of your hair become brittle, dry, and frayed. <br>

                    2) Heat Styling: Curling irons and hair straighteners damage your hair by stripping it of its moisture while leaving it dry. <br>
                    
                    3) Rough Brushing: Over-brushing or rough brushing can weaken your hair <br>
                    
                    4) Hair Coloring: Hair colors contain chemicals that strip your hair of its natural moisture and cause split ends.</p>

                    <h2>TREATMENT OPTIONS</h2>
                    <P>A. Use Hair-Friendly Accessories: Use rubber bands and headbands that have a soft texture to avoid hair damage. <br>

                        B. Brush Your Hair Gently: Never brush wet hair and use a wide-toothed brush to detangle your hair. <br>
                        
                        C. Apply Hair Masks: According to Ayurveda, hair masks nourish the hair naturally and prevent dryness and damage. <br>
                        
                        D. Protect Your Hair From Heat: Minimize the use of heat styling products and cover your head while stepping out in the sun. <br>
                        
                        E. Use A Microfiber Towel: Microfiber towels absorb water faster than regular towels and help dry your hair quickly. Never rub your wet hair with a towel. <br>
                        
                        F. Sleep On A Satin Pillow Cover: Satin creates less or no friction and prevents split ends. <br>
                        
                        G. Get Regular Trims: Regular trimming helps eliminate split ends and gives your hair a healthy appearance.</P>

                <h2>CAUSES</h2>
                <p>1) Imbalance Of Pitta Dosha: Ayurveda suggests that individuals dominant in Pitta dosha have thin hair. Imbalance in Pitta can lead to hair thinning and a receding hairline. <br>

                    2) Heredity: Genetic factors play a crucial role in hair loss and thinning. <br>
                    
                    3) Medical Conditions: Diseases like thyroid and cancer can cause hair thinning. <br>
                    
                    4) DHT: Dihydrotestosterone is an androgen that affects the growth of the hair. <br>
                    
                    5) Tight Hairstyles: Tying hair with a tight rubber band, weakens the hair roots and causes hair fall that leads to hair thinning. <br>
                    
                    6) Poor Diet: Your hair follicles deteriorate in health when they don't receive essential nutrients and minerals. <br>
                    
                    7) Stress: Stress imbalances dosha levels and causes hair thinning.</p>
                    <h2>TREATMENT OPTIONS</h2>
                    <P>A. Ayurvedic Therapies: Hair massage with an essential oil and castor oil are highly beneficial to treat hair thinning. Ayurveda says, wash your hair with herbal shampoo as it helps rejuvenate your hair without causing any side effects. <br>
                        B. Healthy Diet: Eat foods that contain folic acid, biotin, omega-3 fatty acid, iron, zinc, and protein to cure hair thinning. <br>

                        C. Yoga: Yoga increases blood supply in the hair follicles and reduces stress. It also helps balance dosha levels.</P>

                <h2>CAUSES</h2>
                <p>1) Irregular Washing Of Hair: Washing helps clean dirt and excess oil that accumulates on the scalp. Not washing your hair routinely can lead to hair damage and conditions like dandruff.

                    2) Seborrheic Dermatitis: This is a skin condition caused by Malassezia yeast, an organism found on the skin’s surface. It causes itching, redness, and greasy scalp that leads to oily dandruff.
                    
                    3) Stress: Mental stress aggravates the Pitta dosha that triggers sebum production in the scalp and results in dandruff.
                    
                    4) Sensitive Skin: Harmful chemicals present in hair care products can have a negative impact on sensitive skin and lead to dandruff</p>
                    <h2>TREATMENT OPTIONS</h2>
                    <P>A. Hair Mask: Make a paste from any of these ingredients and apply it to your scalp. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes and rinse it off with a mild or herbal shampoo. <br>
                        B. Oil Massage: Head massage with herbal oil is very effective in treating dry dandruff. Oil helps moisturize the scalp naturally and prevents dryness. You can use coconut oil, almond oil, tea tree oil, camphor oil, and neem oil to massage your scalp. <br>

                        C. Regular Washing: Avoid washing your hair every day as it dries up the natural oil in your scalp. The dryness causes dandruff and itching that leads to hair fall. For oily dandruff, it is necessary to wash your hair at least twice or thrice a week with herbal shampoo to keep the scalp clean and healthy. <br>
                        
                        D. Ayurvedic Supplements: Khadirarishta, Amalaki Rasayana, Chalmogra Oil, Gandhak Rasayana, Neem Capsules, Sarivadyasava, Arogyavardhini Vati are some of the Ayurvedic supplements that help balance dosha levels and cure dandruff. But, consult an Ayurvedic doctor before consuming these supplements.</P>
